# Militaria Products Classifier

I made this in order to categorize many of the products I scraped from sites which had no easily dicernable category. With over 70,000 products at my disposal, I managed to get a high level of accuracy.

Currently I am working on getting better data since the data is heavily skewed towards just a few categories. This makes the classifier accurate for majority of the products but very questionable in 
some categories. By finding better sites with more accurate data, more diverse data and double checking that data I should be able to make my data more comprehensive.
